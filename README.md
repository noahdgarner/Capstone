# Capstone Project from UCSD Java Specialization
This program contains a large graph data structures with nodes and edges
represented as text files in the data folder. The graph will run two
algorithms on these files. Each algorithm runs in polynomial time. They calculate the
mimimum dominating sets within a social circle. Simply put, if you want to spread
information quickly within a social network, this algorithm will generate the nodes, ie people,
you should send the information towards in order to get your message out the
quickest!! Really cool stuff, both algorithms work, and are good
per situation.
